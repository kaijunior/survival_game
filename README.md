# Simple Survival Game

This is a simple survival game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game has a player, represented by a blue square, and monsters, represented by red squares. The objective of the game is to avoid the monsters for as long as possible.

## Features

- The player's position follows the cursor. Move the mouse to move the player.
- Monsters are spawned every 9 seconds.
- Monsters move towards the player using a simple form of AI where they adjust their position based on the player's current location.
- Monsters follow the Boids model's separation rule to avoid clustering together.
- When a monster touches the player, the game is over, and an alert message is displayed.
- The game features a scoring system, where players earn one point per second of survival.
- A countdown timer displays the time until the next monster spawns.

This game is a fun project for those interested in JavaScript game development and AI behavior.
